# Smart-Fan
This Smart Fan project automatically adjusts its speed based on temperature and distance. It combines a DHT11 temperature sensor, an ultrasonic distance sensor, a servo motor, and a PWM fan motor, with an LCD for real-time feedback.

## Features:-
- **Automatic Temperature Control** : The fan speed adjusts based on the ambient temperature detected by the DHT11 sensor.
- **Distance Detection** : The ultrasonic sensor switches to manual control when a person is within 15 cm, allowing for speed adjustments using a regulator knob.
- **Regulator Mode** : In this mode we have provided a regulator through which you can control the fan speed manually 
- **LCD Display** : Shows current mode of operation and speed of fan.
- **Bluetooth Control** : Enables remote operation for manual speed adjustments.
